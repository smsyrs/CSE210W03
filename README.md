#Hilo
Hilo is a card game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. You, the player, will start with 300 points. Cards are represented by numbers 1-13. If the guess is correct you will earn 100 points, if not you will lose 75 points. At 0 points the game is over.
